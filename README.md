# plotfs-tools
Welcome! plotfs-tools is a collection of tools (currently just one) that are useful for managing Chia plots on [PlotFS](https://github.com/szatmary/PlotFS).

## plot-importer.py

plot-importer is a simple Python script. Use it to import a whole folder of plotfiles into PlotFS.

usage: python3 plot-importer.py (or execute it). If you're currently in the plotfiles directory, it will start importing straight away, otherwise it will ask you for a path to your plotfiles. Give it a path and off it goes. Simple as that!
